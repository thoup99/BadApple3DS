# BadApple3DS
Play Bad Apple on any modded Nintendo 3DS or with the Citra Emulator. The current version does not have audio, but it will be added at a later time.

#Instalation on 3DS
===================
A modded 3ds console is needed to run this program. If you 3ds is not already modded please follow the guide at https://3ds.hacks.guide/. Please do not follow video tutorials as many of them are outdated.

Remove the SD card from your 3DS while it is powered off and connect it to your computer. Locate the __`3ds`__ folder on the root of your SD card and drag and drop the __`BadApple3ds.3dsx`__ file into it. This file can be retrieved from the latest release section.

#Running on 3DS
===============
After completing the installation, turn on your 3DS and navigate to the homebrew launcher. Locate the BadApple3DS file and press __`A`__ to run it.

#Running on Citra
=================
First start by downloading the __`BadApple3ds.3dsx`__ from the latest release. From there all you have to do is add that file to your roms directory or drag the file into Citra from file explorer.
